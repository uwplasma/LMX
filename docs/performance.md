# Performance and scaling

LMX runs through JAX on CPUs and GPUs. Performance claims are accepted only for
the real solver path with identical numerical results; visibility of multiple
devices alone is not evidence of parallel execution.

## Current evidence

| Path | Hardware and grid | Result | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|
| portable test gate | Apple M4, six workers | 788 pass, 8 skip, 95.34% branch coverage, 210.5 s | below the ten-minute budget |
| B2 axial sharding | 2 x RTX A4000, `102 x 77 x 77` | 36.96 s on one GPU, 22.23 s on two | 1.66x speedup, 83.1% efficiency |
| B1 modal setup | RTX A4000, `11 x 17 x 32` | 57.85 s first, 10.63 s restart | accepted setup optimization |
| B1 large solve | RTX A4000, `21 x 24 x 64` | 270.42 s for two updates | pressure projection is 91.2% of runtime |

The B2 result passes the two-device target and exact observable-equivalence
gate. A general or four-device scaling claim remains open. The B1 timings do
not promote its experimental physics result.

## Run a bounded benchmark

The user-facing example works on any available JAX backend:

```bash
python examples/strong_scaling_demo.py --help
```

For controlled workers and machine-readable records:

```bash
python scripts/run_strong_scaling_worker.py --help
```

Select a backend before importing JAX:

```bash
JAX_PLATFORMS=cpu python examples/strong_scaling_demo.py
JAX_PLATFORMS=cuda CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python examples/strong_scaling_demo.py
```

Production B2 runs accept `num_devices=N`. LMX partitions the axial dimension
with named JAX sharding, validates the global shard count, and compares velocity,
potential, current, conservation, and steady-state signatures against the
one-device baseline. Other extruded solvers remain single-device until they
pass the same gates.

## Measurement contract

A publishable strong-scaling record contains:

- fixed global grid, physics, tolerance, precision, and update count;
- backend, device model, device count, JAX version, and source fingerprint;
- cold time, warm time, throughput, speedup, and parallel efficiency;
- compilation separated from repeated execution;
- shard-placement evidence and per-device memory estimate;
- numerical equivalence, conservation, and convergence results;
- one-device baseline measured in the same environment.

Speedup and efficiency are

```text
S(N) = T(1) / T(N)
E(N) = S(N) / N
```

Small grids often slow down when sharded because dispatch and collectives
dominate. Use representative production grids and report negative results.

## CPU parallelism

JAX/XLA already uses the host CPU pool inside compiled kernels. Running one
solver process per core usually oversubscribes the machine. LMX uses process
parallelism for independent tests or validation cases, and array sharding for
a single sufficiently large solve. The full test driver chooses a bounded
worker count and enforces its wall-clock budget.

## GPU memory and restarts

Long runs should disable aggressive preallocation when several processes share
a host:

```bash
XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_PREALLOCATE=false JAX_PLATFORMS=cuda python -m lmx CASE.toml
```

Use the restart controls in the case file for expensive extruded runs. Restart
files carry source and input metadata so incompatible state is rejected rather
than silently reused.

## Next performance work

1. Reduce B1 pressure-Krylov iterations without weakening its residual gate.
2. Re-measure B1 after numerical equivalence and steady convergence pass.
3. Add a four-GPU B2 point on suitable hardware.
4. Keep compilation-cache and memory measurements in every accelerator report.
