# Numerical methods

LMX uses cell-centered structured finite-volume/finite-difference operators.
Face conductivities and viscosities use distance-aware harmonic interpolation;
the same face fluxes feed conservation diagnostics. Nonuniform meshes retain
their local metric widths.

The fully developed solve alternates electric potential, current/Lorentz
reconstruction, and the axial momentum update until the configured physical
gate passes. The 3-D solve advances momentum, applies a face-flux pressure
projection, enforces the prescribed flow constraint when present, and resolves
electric current closure. Gauge constraints remove the constant nullspace of
pressure and electric potential.

## LMX and SOLVAX

LMX owns:

- geometry metrics and material coefficients;
- boundary and interface equations;
- MHD coupling and dimensional scaling;
- charge, mass, momentum, and power residuals;
- case-level convergence and validation.

SOLVAX owns:

- PCG, GMRES/FGMRES, and fixed-point iteration;
- Jacobi, line, additive, deflation, and Schur preconditioning primitives;
- tridiagonal and sparse direct solves;
- solver state, termination metadata, and implicit linear differentiation.

LMX calls these algorithms with MHD-specific operator actions and then certifies
the returned state in physical units. This keeps solver policy reusable without
moving geometry or physics into SOLVAX.

## Q2D spectral evolution

The periodic Q2D path uses full complex Fourier transforms, the two-thirds
dealiasing rule for the vorticity-advection product, and fourth-order
integrating-factor Runge--Kutta time stepping. Viscous and Hartmann-friction
terms are integrated exactly within each step. SOLVAX supplies the reusable
periodic Poisson symbol and zero-mean spectral inversion for the streamfunction;
LMX owns vorticity dynamics, velocity reconstruction, the energy identity, and
physical acceptance.

The largest stable integration segment is JIT compiled. A positive
`history_stride` divides a run into compiled segments and transfers only the
requested vorticity frames to the host; zero retains no field history. This
keeps the default device-memory cost independent of the number of time steps.

## Accuracy and performance

Analytical and manufactured tests check observed order on refined meshes.
Production claims additionally require stable physical observables, stricter
solver tolerances, and conservation gates. JAX compilation and warm execution
are measured separately. A fully developed solve assembles invariant potential
and velocity coefficients and its preconditioner once, then reuses them at each
coupling step. Repeated cases also benefit from the compilation cache; optional
output and histories should remain disabled when memory is the limiting resource.
